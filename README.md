# csElectricFieldSimulator

Small application i made to practice some things i learnt in physics class!
Made with [Raylib-CsLo](https://github.com/NotNotTech/Raylib-CsLo)

## Controls
- Right click to add a positive charge
- Left click to add a negative charge
- Right click on a charge to remove it
- Hold left click on a charge to move it around
- Middle click to get rid of all charges

## Note
Visual Studio said something about missing files when i created this repo, but that might be the nuget package.. make an issue and i will add whatever is missing!
